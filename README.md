# Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset 🚢

This repository contains my internship task at **Elevvo**, where I performed an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic Titanic dataset. The goal was to uncover meaningful insights, visualize survival patterns, and prepare the data for potential predictive modeling.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular datasets for data science beginners. It contains passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, and survival status.  
Through this project, I applied data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques to explore hidden trends and correlations.

## 🛠️ Key Tasks
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handling missing values, duplicates, and categorical encoding).
- Used **data visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to highlight relationships.
- Identified factors that influenced passenger survival (e.g., gender, class, family size).
- Summarized insights

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Insights Gained
- **Gender:** Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.  
- **Class:** Passengers in **1st class** were more likely to survive compared to 2nd and 3rd class.  
- **Family Size:** Both very small and very large families had lower survival chances compared to medium-sized families.
